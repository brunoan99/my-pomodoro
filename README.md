# **My-Pomodoro**

The ***Pomodoro*** technique is a time management method where you work on a task for 25 minutes (called a "Pomodoro") without distractions, followed by a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This technique helps improve focus, productivity, and combat procrastination.
